For loading the project, you need to have a username and password.

Username - Andrew

Password - 123

If you encounter an issue when opening the project, please close the project and open it again. 
The issue is related to creating a file on the local computer when app is first loaded. The second time you open the project, the app should work properly.

FYI on a separate branch, we have another version of the project which saves the file in .json format.
